Reverse-icmp-shell is a simple server and client that utilized the ICMP protocol to transfer the data.
Imagine your server can only ping you and you cannot ping your server. 
This tool can help you to still pop a shell on the server.

This tool is for demostration and pentesting only. Use it on your own risk and only if you have permission of the system owners.

The difference with the original version Peter posted is that this version initiates the 'connection' from the server instead of the client.
